## To develop
Due the time limit of this test, some features and improvements could not be developed and based on the UI prototype could be developed:
- Finish the dropdown menu development
- Open the search bar on click on the search icon in the navbar
- Mobile version (including a side bar menu and reponsive layout that a mobile version needs)
- Some animations on menus and on hover buttons and banners
- Tweaks in the spacing and font sizes
